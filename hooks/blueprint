# This script outputs the list of merge files needed to support the desired
# feature set selected by the environment parameter file.  As generated, it
# lists all *.yml files in the base, then all *.yml files in each detected
# feature directory, in the order the features are specified in the environment
# yml file.  If finer control is desired, add logic around the wants_kit_feature()
# function (takes a feature as a string, returns exit code 0 if present, non-
# zero exit code otherwise).
